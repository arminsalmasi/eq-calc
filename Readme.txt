Dear All

Attached is:

-The pdf that I went through that also contain the home assignment (ctms_hl)

-A simple matlab function that return Gibbs energy along with the first and second derivatives as well as the chemical potentials for a hypothetical binary system A-B (binary_regular_solution)

-An article (Larsson_Jansson_Calphad_51_2015_220). The main subject of the article you can disregard (unless you're interested), but section 2 and the beginning of section 4 (up to Eq. 27) is relevant with regards to the home assignment.

-An instruction on how to install Thermo-Calc on your computer

-Two ancient Thermo-Calc documents (TCCS_Examples and TCCS_UsersGuide). 
If you are completely new to Thermo-Calc I suggest that you simply start with the first few examples and type in each command. You will quickly familiarize yourself with the most common commands. However, note that it is not necessary to use Thermo-Calc in order to do the home assignment. More recent and updated manuals can be downloaded from the Thermo-Calc homepage.

-A small thermodynamic database (CORR.TDB) that contain the same phases as the matlab function

Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions.

Cheers,

Henrik
